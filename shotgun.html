                     An exit sign illuminates the white wallpapered walls, <br> </br>
as the subway systemHer vision blurred under the strain of the tears as Amelia sat on the bus on the way from school, curled against the cool window that soothed her red hot face. Matt had his arm around her and tried to soothe her but he knew she was irreconcilable at this point. Her eye makeup dripped from her eyelids to the hem of her mint green sweater, it was already beginning to stain. Her eyes seemed like a disrupted Christmas celebration as her green iris stood horribly contrast against the red color that replaced the white of the eyes. She knew she looked like a mess but she just couldn’t stop crying. She hadn’t stop since she left class, and she was fairly sure she wouldn’t stop for another three hours, at the very least. Every time that her mind began drift, it always went back to that class. <br></br>
“Amelia you should write a letter to the principle or something. This is getting out of hand”  Matt finally broke the silence of her tears. <br></br>
Amelia just choked on her tears and moved her face closer to the window pane of the bus. Her face was getting hot again. <br></br>
“Amelia, I’m serious. This is the third time this week you’ve left school like this. You need to tell someone besides me about what’s going on in that class.” Matt sounded seriously concerned. He hated to she her like this. <br></br>
“There’s nothing I- I can do! I’ve tried and I’ve tried!” Her voiced started to sound screechy. She turned to Matt who looked at her like she was a puppy dying in the middle of a cold, desolate street. <br></br>
“There’s always something that can be done.” Matt said kindly. <br></br>
The bus made a harsh stop sending Amelia’s head to the window. She cried out in pain and they just continued crying. Matt got up to let her out. It was her stop. She got up and Matt gave her a giant hug. <br></br>
'It will be okay" he said. <br></br>
Amelia retuned the hug and staggered off the bus with her head to the floor. She walked back to her desolate house. Both her parents were still at work and Jamie didn't get out until four. Amelia looked at the house with the dirty front porch that looked like it would collapse if someone stepped on the decaying wood . There were the white paneled walls that looked more of a grayish brown then white and the blue lining that attempted to light up the house. It was two stories of hell and she never considered it her home she thought. It was always the house, her home was in Queens but her family left there two years ago to move out here and everything had gone downhill from there. <br></br>
She walked up the crotchety porch that creaked with her every stepped. She wiped the remaining tears from her eyes and opened the front door. She ran to her room and cried. She needed to let out this pain. She laid on her unmade bed and remembered the class and let it all out. <br></br>
 
---------
<br></br>
She walked down the hallway with Matt already fearing what was in store. She was shaking a little as she walked. Matt noticed and put his arm around. <br></br>
"It will be okay sweetie, I promise"<br></br>
That didn't make Amelia feel any better but she appreciated the thought of havering to go through this hell again. <br></br>
He was waiting at door, ready to torture her. Amelia was sure it was the only thing he looked forward to. <br></br>
" Well look who finally decided to show up" he stared at them condescendingly. " Get in before I mark you two late."<br></br>
Amelia's head dropped to the floor. As she walked her he grabbed the back of her ass. <br></br>
Matt glared at him and pushed Amelia into the room. She could already feel the tears welling up in her eyes. She sat down and hid behind her textbook. <br></br>
"Now that we're all finally here, I think we can begin class. Or do you want two more minutes to attempt to fix up that face of yours Amelia?"<br></br>
Everyone stared at her. They were all looking at her, crying, hiding behind her book. <br></br>
"No need to hide your face, we all already know what it looks like."<br></br>
Some kids laughed, other just looked at her with pity. <br></br>
He started the lesson then. First he went over the homework and he called on Amelia to answer every question. She tried to answer at first but then he would yell at her for stuttering or ask her, <br></br>
" Do you enjoy embarrassing yourself? Why on earth would you take such a difficult class when it's evident that you know absolutely nothing about US history? Do you enjoy this? "<br></br>
After a while she just stopped answering. She just sat there laying on her book. <br></br>
"Fucking idiot" the boy behind her whispered. <br></br>
He then moved on to the lesson and gave a PowerPoint using silly accents to describe the Mexican American war. Everyone was laughing and enjoying the class except for Amelia who just continued to lay, refusing to look up because she knew she would cry. <br></br>
The bell finally rang and Amelia got up and practically ran out of the class room but he stopped her. <br></br>
"Amelia" he said grabbing her arm before she could leave. <br></br>
" You really can't sleep through class. I want you to write me an essay  on the Mexican American war tonight to make up for what you missed today or else I'm going to call on you again tomorrow to answer all the questions." He spoke plain and he started to move his hand up her leg when the class emptied. <br></br>
"Please stop"<br></br>
"Stop what. I'm your teacher and I just want to make sure..." His hand made it's way up her skirt " that you get the education you need." He pinched the rim of the lace around her thong. She could hear it snap back against her skin. <br></br>
Amelia shoved him away and ran out of class.
Matt was waiting for her in the hallway but she ran past him. She ran last everyone and just cried her way to the bus. <br></br>
-----------<br></br>
Jamie walked into the room and saw Amelia crying. <br></br>
"Again?"he asked, laughing a little to himself. <br></br>
"Jamie I can't do this anymore. Matts right I need to write a letter or something..."<br></br>
Jamie sat down next to her and wiped away the tears. <br></br>
"Amelia what happened. Why do you hate Mr. Chars so much? He was my favorite teacher. He was everyone's favorite teacher. He's even won best teacher for the last three years in a row. What the hell is your problem with him."<br></br>
Amelia started to cry again. <br></br>
" He always calls on me Jamie... Everyday. He calls me out. He makes me feel stupid!"<br></br>
"Amelia he's just trying to make you angry so you'll try harder. He did the same thing to me and I left senior year with straight A's."<br></br>
Jamie sounded condescending. <br></br>
" It's not just that Jamie! He...he " her voice dropped to a whisper. <br></br>
"He touches me"<br></br>
"Yeah right"<br></br>
"Jamie!"<br></br>
"Now your just spouting lies!" Jamie looked at her disappointed. He looked her in the eyes and said, "You know a girl in my year tried to get him fired by saying that. No one believed her though because it was so obviously a lie. Why would he do something like that? He's the nicest man..."<br></br>
Amelia screamed " HE PINCHED MY THONG JAMIE. HE GRABBED MY ASS!"<br></br>
"Stop lying! No one is going to believe you!"<br></br>
"Matt saw! Matt knows !"<br></br>
"Yeah because you little faggot of a best friend is really going to convince the school board that their star teacher is a child molester"<br></br>
Amelia smacked him. <br></br>
" Don't you dare call Matt that"<br></br>
They were silent for a minute. <br></br>
" I'm your sister Jamie. I'm telling you the truth."<br></br>
Jamie got up now <br></br>
"But you're not! I know you! You're just scared that you going to fail for the first time in your life so your making up lies instead of dealing with you actual problems . Get your shit together Amelia, I'm done!"<br></br>
He slammed the door behind him. Some on her posters feel from her wall. Amelia screamed in anguish. If her own brother wouldn’t believe her than how could she expect her parents, or the school board or anyone else to. She looked at the door where Jamie left and got up to get the posters. When she looked closer they weren’t posters but certificates she had won in the past. There was a certificate for “Best in Class”,”Highest History Grade”, and ”Student of the Year.” She looked at her wall and there were several more still up there. <br></br>
She started to rip them a part one, by one. She laughed whenever the paper ripped. Soon her wall was empty except for the project that she did on John Wilkes Booth last year. She had won an award for it but that was already torn apart and amongst the scraps on her floor. She started to read the report, tearing it a part page by page until she was hit with a stroke of brilliance. She cleared away the scraps from her desk and she began to write her essay and for the first time that day, she smiled. <br></br>
Amelia hopped on the bus the next morning and sat down next to Matt. Only a little bit of her tea spilled out of her typical morning cup and Matt was relatively impressed with this feat. Usually she looses half of her tea before she even reaches the bus. Amelia smiled at Matt and greeted him. She seemed unusually happy to get going to school after what happened to her yesterday, but if she was happy, Matt was happy, although mildly concerned. Amelia opened her coffee stained, practically collapsing messenger bag to make sure that she had all her things. <br></br>
“Are you okay Amelia” <br></br>
“Yeah” she said, staring at the gun in her bag. <br></br>
She smiled a little at the thought, a gun, in her bag. It was her dad’s hand gun that he insisted on getting “incase there was ever an intruder” but Amelia always thought that her dad just liked the idea of owning a gun and the power that came with it. <br></br>
She pulled out the essay and gave it to Matt. Matt read the title out loud. <br></br>
“‘Why this class is a joke.’ Are you sure about this?” <br></br>
She beamed at Matt, “Positive!” <br></br>
Amelia and Matt talked until they reached school. They went their separate ways throughout the day until lunch. All Amelia could think of was the gun in her bag. Would she have the nerve to do it? What if she chickened out? No, she would do it. Amelia was confident. She did not care what would happen. She was ending this today. <br></br>
At lunch Amelia and Matt talked idly. Matt was still really concerned about Amelia. It was weird that she had made such a quick recovery. <br></br>
“Amelia are you really okay?” <br></br>
Her eyes darted from her sandwich to Matt. She knew he was worried. <br></br>
“Matt, I’m seriously okay.” <br></br>
“Even after yesterday?” <br></br>
“It’s okay Matt. I talked to someone about it and I decided to do something about it.” <br></br>
“Who?” <br></br>
“Jamie.” Technically she wasn’t lying. <br></br>
“And you’re going to go to the school board about it.” <br></br>
“We’re still figuring it out.” <br></br>
“Well, I’m glad you talked to someone about it, just don’t do anything too...” <br></br>
The bell rang before Matt could finish. He still thought something was going wrong. He knew that Jamie had never really been the caring older brother but he wouldn’t just ignore his sister when she talked to him about sexual harassment. Right? Matt had tried to take it up with the school but they just ignored him. Maybe if Jamie got their parents involved it would be okay. Matt didn’t know what to think anymore. He gathered his things and he and Amelia walked to class. <br></br>
Amelia wasn’t shaking as she approached the door. She even waved at Mr. Chards. “You seem perky today” he said mimicking her bouncing chest with his hands. Amelia just pulled out her essay and gave it to him. He shoved it back to her and said, “Oh no. You’re reading this in front of the class.” Matt looked at her in fear but Amelia just smiled. <br></br>
“Of course.” <br></br>
They made their way to their seats and waited for the bell to ring. Once everyone made it inside Mr. Chards started class. <br></br>
“Today we shall be beginning with what will hopefully be a review of yesterday for most of you. Amelia shall read the assignment she did to make up for her incompetence yesterday.” <br></br>
 Some kids laughed as Amelia stood up. She made her way to the front of the class. <br></br>
“Why this class is a joke. One, every single person in this room has got it into their heads that I’m some sort of idiot despite the fact that I have  had the highest GPA in the school for the last three years. Two, no one finds it weird or violent that the teacher is constantly harassing his students to the point that they cry. In fact, they actually defend the teacher saying that it is his ‘teaching method.’ Three, despite the fact that we have been in class for five months, we have only finished three chapters of of text book. Four, despite the fact that everyone in the room has two working eyes, Matt is the only one who ever notices the fact that Mr. Chards finds a way to grab my ass every single day. Five..” <br></br>
Mr. Chards grabbed my paper at that point. Everyone stood there in silence. He tore up the paper in front of the class. <br></br>
Mr. Chards laughed, “Oh, Amelia. That paper was hysterical.” He continued laughing and several of the students followed his lead. Matt looked horrified. <br></br>
“But it was not the assignment. Could you see me in the hallway for a minute? He said trying to sound calm. <br></br>
Amelia walked into the hallway with her bad swinging at her side.  Mr. Chards followed her out and slammed the door behind him. As soon as he faced Amelia he pinned her against the locker.
“Now listen here you little slut. You think anyone in there believes you. They were laughing at you the moment you finished. You don’t think I won’t get you expelled for this. You’re trying to ruin my credibility you mongrel.” <br></br>
He threw her on the floor. Amelia started to look in her bag for the gun. <br></br>
“ Are you really that stupid to think you could get away with this.” He picked her up off the flood and cornered her against the locker again. <br></br>
“The only thing anyone’s going to miss after you’re gone is that fine piece of ass you got there.” <br></br>
He started to bring his hand up her skirt again but this time she didn’t miss a beat. She grabbed the gun from her bag, pointed it at his head and fired. <br></br>
The shock propelled her against the wall. She fell to her knees. Mr. Chards fell backwards. His head was gushing with blood. Amelia couldn’t help but laugh and cry at the same time and she finally felt at peace.<br></br>
