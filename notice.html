                    	She sees what you are wearing for school today,  a nice long sweater and skirt. She sees you take your medicine and eat your toast and eggs. She does not see the slip of food you give to your dog. She sees you kiss her goodbye. She sees the big smile you give her as you run towards the bus and she shouts after you. Have fun at school. She does not see the tears that fall from your eyes the minute you turn around. <br></br>
	She sees you come home from school. How was it honey? She does not see the numerous failed exams in your back pack. She sees you put down your bag. She sees Tom follow in after you. She has seen Tom every day for the past three months since you and Tom started dating.  She does not see the bruises Tom left under the sweater or the cuts and scars that have been there even longer than that. She sees you and Tom leave the house together. She does not see the forced kisses. She does not see Tom hit you in the car so hard that you cannot feel your cheek for an hour. She sees the van drive away. What a nice boy. <br></br>
	She sees you come home with a bruise so red it looked like Satan himself put it there. She sees you ice it and does not question that you fell.  She sees you take your medicine. She does not see you slip more pills into your pocket. She sees you lie in your bed and kisses you goodnight. It will be better in the morning. <br></br>
	She does not see you grab the rope you have had underneath your bed for a month. She does not see you tie a noose into the rope, like you have done every night for the past week. She does not see you re-write your suicide note. She does not see you cry while you do it. She does not see you tie the end of rope underneath the bed . She does not see you take the rest of the medication. She does not see you climb the chair. She does not see you pull the noose over your head. She does not see you pray. She does not see you kick the chair away. <br></br>
	She sees your hanging corpse in the morning and she cries. She sees the suicide note and reads its. She sees the failed test grades.  She sees the scars on your wrist. She sees the bruises under the sweater and at long last, she sees why you did it. <br></br>
