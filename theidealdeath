                    <h2> Music boxes are cursed portals into a forgotten land. <br> </br>
The devious clanking melody that strums the air<br> </br>
when the deviant box is opened is the only remains<br> </br>
of sound after the land’s dubious destruction. <br> </br>
I clutched this cursed portal in my callous hands,<br> </br>
ripping the lid opened and close as if to simultaneously <br> </br>
disrupt and continue the trembling tune.<br> </br>
I was riding in the passenger seat of my uncle’s hearse,<br> </br>
not only because there was no room in the limo, <br> </br>
but because I had always wanted to ride in the corpse mobile<br> </br>
while alive. “Could you stop with the box.” Rick,<br> </br>
the death cabby said to me frigidly, taking his eyes off<br> </br>
the road just long enough for him to not notice the car<br> </br>
in front of us stopping short. The music box cracked.<br> </br>
Shards broke off from the mirror in the music box<br> </br>
that had more dust than glass. They hammered <br> </br>
themselves into my eye and I saw this lost world.<br> </br>
Rustic robotic trees stood stark against the gold wind,<br> </br>
and a boy, who I named Derek, had clocks for corneas.<br> </br>
He screamed as he watched the blood drip from<br> </br>
my eye like time drips from an hourglass, <br> </br>
and I imagined that’s what his eyes would literally look<br> </br> 
like should they start bleeding. I cried out in horror<br> </br>
but the cry was just that melancholic tune from<br> </br>
the shattered music box whose ancient wood stained<br> </br>
my skin with it’s texture like diseased ink. <br> </br>
No words, just song. I felt no pain nor pulse.<br> </br>
The box was truly a portal to another world, <br> </br>
but I began to wonder if it was indeed a forgotten one.<br> </br>
They say Hell is cold. <br> </br>
