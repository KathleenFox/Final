            <div id="slider"> 
             
                  
                   
                    <p>
                     She was coming today! In less than ten minutes, she would walk through that door, give me a kiss on the cheek, and tell me about her day. She promised me she was coming this Wednesday at five, after her debate team got out. Sheʼs such a bright girl. A slightly awkward girl, with the frizzy red hair, and, my goodness, the nuns would have broke her back trying to fix that posture of hers, but a nice girl. A sweet girl. Always smiling under those braces. She looked like her mother. Did Cheryl have braces? Did I get her braces? I donʼ think so, let my find that album.<br></br>
!	It was in the bookshelf across from the first- floor-bed. We had to put the bed on the first floor a couple of years ago after Tom died. They didnʼt want me walking up the stairs with nobody else around to call an ambulance if, God forbid, I fell. So they went trough all this effort to keep me on the first floor so they wouldnʼt find my decaying corpse when they came to visit. Such thoughtful children, if only they actually came to visit.<br></br>
!	Iʼm not bitter though. They have their own lives now and their own children. Though it wouldnʼt hurt to call every now and then, I mean, sheesh, just because Iʼm on the first floor doesnʼt mean I still canʼt fall. !	Anyways, I grabbed the album from the shelf and sat on my first-floor-bed. The thing was falling apart. It had to be at least thirty years old. Cherylʼs forty now... and me<br></br>
and Tom picked this out for her when she was ten, so it was actually thirty years old. The duck tape I put on it a couple of years ago was starting to fall off. Maybe it was time for some new duck tape? Actually, maybe it was time for a new album. !	I flipped through the pages. My goodness, Allie looked just like her mother. Cheryl had that frizzy red hair too. It was actually worse than Allieʼs, because at least Allie has all those new hair products to keep it under control. Cheryl just had to let it fly free, the poor thing. I donʼt think I got her braces either. Nope. Look her, itʼs a picture of here, when she was a sophomore in high school, Allie age now. Her teeth looked more crooked than a politician's bank account. I wonder if she ever got them fixed. Iʼll have to ask Allie when she comes. Johnny never had problem with his teeth, but his hair, bless his heart, it was worse than Cherylʼs. He tried everything. He got a part time job so he could afford some hair products to gel it down. He tried to buzz cut it. At one point, I think he even shaved himself bald. He could not stand his frizzy red hair. They got it from me too, the poor things. My hair is far too thin now to do anything though. I know Cheryl straightens her hair. It looks nice on her, much better than the frizz. I wish we could have given her better. !	She ended up all right though. She has a lovely husband and a beautiful child. Speaking of which, where was Allie? Itʼs 5:30. Maybe her debate team meeting was running a bit late. Maybe I should put some supper on? Sheʼs gonna be hungry when she finally gets out of that meeting. !	I put the book on my bed, so I would remember to show Allie later, and I got up to go put on a nice meal. Ambulance sirens wailed downed the street as I walked into the kitchen. Brooklyn was such a noisy place. Thereʼs so many people, and someone
always seems to be getting hurt. I remember when Johnny had to be taken to the hospital. He had to ride in the ambulance and his foot was almost amputated. He was coming home from school one day and he was real ancy to get home. Heʼs always been so impatient, that boy. He was waiting for the light to change, and he stepped a little too far out into the road and a car sped over his foot. The car didnʼt even stop to see if he was okay or anything, just kept speeding along. Some people have no manners. He was like twenty blocks away from home and some stranger called an ambulance for him. Tom and I raced towards the hospital and when we got there we found out that we had to pay the fee for the ambulance. Do you know how much ambulances costs? My goodness, itʼs a wonder how people can pay for treatment after the pay the fee to get there. But Johnny kept his foot and all was all right. When we had Cheryl, I made sure Tom drove me to the hospital or we wouldnʼt be able to afford the baby. !	So I got into the kitchen and I got ready to put on some mac and cheese for Allie. This girl was such a picky eater. She refuses to eat hamburgers, says they taste funny. When she eats spaghetti, she wonʼt have any tomato sauce on it. She hates how it looks. She wonʼt eat bacon unless itʼs burned to a crisp. Her mother spoils her. She has such specific diet that the doctor had to put her on pills to catch up with her daily nutrients. !	But she loves mac and cheese. I swear, sheʼll eat it at least once a day. When she came over last time, she ate three, whole, bowls. I personally never loved the stuff, but I could eat it now and then. I would never go out of my way to make it, but if Allie eats it, itʼs worth it.<br></br>
!	She told me last time that she started to take a cooking class at school but she never eats what she makes. Her teacher has her making pies and rice and those hamburgers Allie canʼt stand. She cook up all the stuff real nice because she wants a good grade, but then sheʼll give the food to her friends to eat. She hopes that one day the teacher will teach a lesson on mac and cheese so sheʼll be able to eat the food she makes.<br></br>
!	She really should be here by now. Itʼs already six. I hope the debate team isnʼt keeping her that long. Sheʼs the treasurer of the club. I told her she should go for president, but sheʼs so shy, she said sheʼd just be happy to be considered for treasurer. She loves the debate team. She said last week that they were planning a trip to Washington DC next week and she would be coming later than usual.<br></br>
!	She visits me every Wednesday at four oʼclock, and we sit and talk, and I make her mac and cheese, and then we read for a bit. Then around eight, sheʼll kiss me goodbye and take the subway home to her mother. I would drive her, but they took away my license years ago. She has come to see me every Wednesday for the past four years and theyʼve always been the high light of my week. Iʼm lucky if I get a phone call from Johnny on the holidays or if Cheryl comes by once a month to bring me to mass. She often forgets. But I have Allie and we enjoy our little time together.
!	I wonder if sheʼs in charge of planning trip to Washington DC. Sheʼs a clumsy child, always tripping and falling, but sheʼs very organized. She planned my 70th birthday party all by herself. She reserved a spot at that cute little restaurant around the corner with the pink curtains. She invited my family, and my old friends and catered food. She even made a cute little video made of the pictures from my albums. I donʼt
know how she got them from pictures into the video but she did an amazing job and she planned it all herself. Cheryl gave her the money of course, but she put it all together. Sheʼd be great at planning a trip to Washington DC, I bet thatʼs why sheʼs so late. Sheʼs probably putting together these complex plans to make sure they have the best time possible when theyʼre there.
!	I poured the macaroni into the boiling water. I hope sheʼs here soon, I wouldnʼt want her to eat cold food. I should probably go find the book we were reading last week so I wonʼt waste any time when she comes. We were reading Tuesdays With Morrie by Mitch Album. Allie was reading about him in class. Apparently he used to be a sports writer before he wrote the book. Allie never read Tuesdays with Morrie but I think she enjoyed reading it last week. We would take turns reading it aloud. She has a very nice reading voice, the kind that made you feel like you were watching a television program. I loved hearing her read, but sometimes she needs a break so I take over. I used to read with Cheryl and Johnny when they were young, but they never liked it much. They would always fall asleep or run away, but Allie loves it. !	I went into the back room and found the book on the counter. I wanted to re-read a bit before she came today, so I read it while I was doing laundry. There used to be so many clothes that went through this machine in a single wash, and now itʼs just a couple of my shirts and pants. Itʼs a little sad. !	I picked up the book and brought it back with me into the kitchen. I poured out the macaroni into a bowl. It was 6:30. There was no possible way the debate club would keep her this late. I picked up the phone and call phone number, I had it on the fridge.<br></br>
For her fifthteenth birthday, Cheryl bought her a cell phone. She was so excited and gave everyone her number. I kept it on the fridge in case I ever needed to call her. !	Voice Mail. Maybe she had her phone turned off. Even though she wanted that phone so much, she was constantly loosing her phone because she turned it off. She left it at my house twice since she got it. The first time it had fallen underneath my first- floor bed when we were reading. The second time, she was on the kitchen floor. She said she probably dropped it whilst eating her mac and cheese.<br></br>
!	I tried to call Cheryl next, but her husband picked up and said that they couldnʼt talk right now. I tried to ask where Allie was, but he hung up on me. I never did like him very much. Steven was a good looking man, donʼt get me wrong, but he always seemed to be in a bad mood. Allie thinks itʼs because he works too much. He doesnʼt have the time to relax and talk to people, itʼs only work and sleep. !	I would have hated it if Tom was like that. He worked at the bank that used to be up the block. They tore it down a couple of years ago to build a hair salon. Tom used to work there nine-to-five, but he always made sure he was home at five. He didnʼt make much money, but he made enough for me, Cheryl, and Johnny. We had this nice house, we all had decent clothes, and we were always able to get nice Christmas gifts for everyone. I remember that one Christmas when we got Cheryl her first barbie. My goodness, her smile was brighter than the lights on the Christmas tree. It was all she wanted that year. She would talk about it constantly. She wrote three letters to Santa, just in case the other two letters got lost. I have never seen her happier. !	Tom loved Christmas. He always worked hard enough to make sure he got a Christmas bonus so we could all have a nice Christmas. Tom was a great man. He was
a happy man, he loved me and his children. He loved his grandchildren too. I remember the first time I met. We were having this dance at the high school which was rare because the nuns hated hosting events. They invited the boys from Xavier School to come to our little event and Tom was there, dressed in a bright red truck. Everyone called him fire truck boy that night. I remember how he came up to me, even though I was surrounded by a group of my friends, and he asked me to dance. And, my goodness, we danced the night away. We danced to every song they played. He made me laugh so much.We started dating a little after that and then he proposed after I graduated high school.<br></br>
!	He died ten years ago after Christmas. Cancer. He had to make it to Christmas though. He refused to let the good lord take him until he had his Christmas. We all visited him in the hospital. We decorated the room and bought real food over for him. We all exchanged presents and caroled throughout the hospital. He died the next morning. We had his funeral soon after and that was the last time I saw Johnny.<br></br>
!	Johnny never liked funerals but he always saw them as necessary. When my father died, Cheryl was too upset to attend the funeral, but Johnny insisted that he had to go and say goodbye. He went to every funeral, for every loved on, even if he didnʼt know them well. Sometimes I worried that the only time Iʼll see Johnny if is someone died. That seems to be the only time he really comes around since he moved to Massachusetts.. !	It 7 oʼclock, she should really be here by now. I tried her phone again, but no response. I wonder what Cheryl and Steve were so concerned with that they tell me where their daughter is.
!	Maybe sheʼs not coming. Maybe she forgot after having so much fun with her debate team. Maybe she just doesnʼt want to come anymore. Sheʼs probably sick of spending all this time with her grandmother. She has friends now and clubs. She can make mac and cheese on her own. Maybe she just didnʼt want to tell me that she doesnʼt want to see me anymore. Sheʼs too nice for that.<br></br>
!	Our time together has grown a bit repetitive. Maybe I should have mixed it up more. Maybe we should have watched movies rather than read books. Maybe I should have made her something besides mac and cheese. My goodness, the child must have grown sick of it by now. I should have made her sandwiches or steak. She has to like something besides mac and cheese. Maybe she really hated Tuesdays with Morrie and she just didnʼt have the heart to tell me. Maybe she just didnʼt like talking to me anymore. !	No that was too much. She had to be coming she had to be. She loved mac and cheese and talking about her life. She loved reading in her impressive reading voice. She loved how I would fuss over her hair and ask about her mom. She loved spending time with me. She loved me. She had to be coming. !	!	I heard someone pounding on the door. Allie! She was finally here! Where could she have been? I rushed to the door and opened it. !	It was Cheryl. She was crying. !	“Cheryl whatʼs wrong? Whereʼs Allie?” !	She choked on her tears at the sound of Allieʼs name. !	“Sheʼs not coming Mom.” Cheryl cried.<br></br>
!	“What do you mean sheʼs not coming? She promised. Wednesday, at five after she finished her debate club meeting. She was staying later because theyʼre planning a trip to Washington, DC.” !	“Thereʼs been an accident. Mom we need to go.” she said softly<br></br>
!	“What happened? Whereʼs Allie!” Please. Dear God, donʼt let her say what I think sheʼs going to say. Let this be some horrible, elaborate joke. !	“Sheʼs dead mom.” !	No. She couldnʼt be dead. No, this was something else. She...she canʼt be dead. !	“Get out.” I said. !	Maybe she was tired of seeing me. Maybe she doesnʼt want to come anymore and she put Cheryl up to this. Cheryl always spoiled her. “She tripped on the way to your house. Didnʼt you hear the ambulance? It was a cross the street. Some girl was texting and...” !	She broke out into hysterics. !	“Get out.” !	“Mom!” !	“Get out! I will not have you come into my house telling lies to your own mother. If she doesnʼt want to see me anymore fine, but this...haven't I suffered enough” !	“Mom. Stop. Sheʼs dead. Sheʼs gone...she's gone” !	Tears started to fall. My legs collapsed and Cheryl caught me. I woke up the next morning and for a second I thought it was just a dream, but then saw Johnny next to me for the first time in ten years and I knew it wasnʼt. She was gone.<br></br>
!	“Mom, Iʼm so sorry” Johnny cried as he saw me wake up. He looked more like his father now. Tall and handsome, with those bright blue eyes. His eyes were tear strained now though. He sat hunched over, dressed in all black<br></br>
! ! ! He gave a slow nod. Everything was a blur. I just kept crying as Johnny got me dressed. I couldnʼt think, I couldnʼt speak, I could only cry. It was all over. She had her whole life a head of her. She was going to finish reading Tuesdays with Morrie. She was going to make mac and cheese in class and eat it all. She was going to go to Washington, DC and have the time of her life. She was going to go to college and master whatever craft she chose. She was going to get married and have kids. And one day, she was going to attend my funeral and now here I am, drenched in the tears of what could have been, getting ready for hers.<br></br>
